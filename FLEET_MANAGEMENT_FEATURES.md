# Fleet Management Module - Feature Documentation

## 🎯 Overview

A comprehensive fleet management system has been built for the React + Firebase authentication application. This system allows administrators and operators to manage vehicles, assign drivers, and track fleet operations with role-based access control.

## ✅ **Completed Features**

- **Location**: Admin Dashboard → Fleet Management Tab / Operator Dashboard → Fleet Management Tab
- **Access**: Admin and Operator roles
- **Real-time fleet statistics with visual cards**
- **Responsive design with TailwindCSS**

### **2. Vehicle Data Structure**
Each vehicle has the following metadata stored in Firebase Firestore:
```javascript
{
  id: "firestore-document-id",
  vehicleName: "Delivery Van Alpha",
  plateNumber: "DV-001-A",
  fuelType: "diesel" | "gasoline" | "electric" | "hybrid",
  driverId: "firebase-user-uid" | null,
  mileage: 45000,
  status: "active" | "maintenance" | "inactive",
  createdAt: timestamp,
  updatedAt: timestamp,
  createdBy: "admin-user-uid",
  updatedBy: "admin-user-uid"
}
```

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Firebase Firestore Operations**
- `getAllVehicles()` - Fetch all vehicles with pagination support
- `createVehicle()` - Create new vehicle with validation
- `updateVehicle()` - Update vehicle information
- `assignDriverToVehicle()` - Assign driver to vehicle
- `removeDriverFromVehicle()` - Remove driver assignment
- `deleteVehicle()` - Hard delete vehicle
- `searchVehicles()` - Search functionality
- `getVehiclesByFuelType()` - Filter by fuel type
- `getVehiclesByStatus()` - Filter by status
- `getVehiclesByDriver()` - Get vehicles by driver
- `updateVehicleStatus()` - Update vehicle status

### **React Components**
- **FleetManagement**: Main dashboard with stats and filters
- **VehicleList**: Table component with actions and driver resolution
- **AddVehicleModal**: Form for creating new vehicles
- **EditVehicleModal**: Form for editing existing vehicles
- **AssignDriverModal**: Specialized driver assignment interface

### **State Management**
- React hooks for local state
- Firebase real-time updates
- Error handling and loading states
- Form validation and user feedback

## 🚀 **Usage Instructions**

### **For Administrators and Operators:**

1. **Access Fleet Management**
   - Log in as Admin or Operator
   - Go to respective Dashboard
   - Click "Fleet Management" tab

2. **Add New Vehicles**
   - Click "Add Vehicle" button
   - Fill in vehicle details (name, plate number, fuel type)
   - Optionally assign a driver
   - Set initial mileage and status

3. **Manage Existing Vehicles**
   - Use search bar to find specific vehicles
   - Filter by fuel type or status using dropdowns
   - Click "Edit" to modify vehicle information
